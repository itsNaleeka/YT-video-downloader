## 💡 About This Project

I'm currently learning Python, and this is one of the beginner-friendly GUI projects I've built along the way. It's a fun project to get hands-on experience with:

* GUI development using `customtkinter`
* Threading
* File handling
* API usage with `yt-dlp`
* Executable packaging with `PyInstaller`
* GUI polish (splash screen, icons, etc.)
